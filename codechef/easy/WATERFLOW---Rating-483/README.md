## Problem

### Bucket and Water Flow

Alice has a bucket of water initially having $W$ litres of water in it. The maximum capacity of the bucket is $X$ liters.

Alice turned on the tap and the water starts flowing into the bucket at a rate of $Y$ litres/hour. She left the tap running for exactly $Z$ hours. Determine whether the bucket has been overflown, filled exactly, or is still left unfilled.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
- Each test case consists of a single line of input containing four space-separated integers $W,\ X,\ Y,\ Z$.
### Output Format

For each test case, print the answer on a new line:

- If the bucket has overflown print overflow
- If it is exactly filled print filled
- If it is still unfilled, print unfilled

You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings `filled`, `FIlled`, `fiLLed`, and `FILLED` will all be treated as identical).

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq W,X,Y,Z \leq 1000$
### Subtasks
- Subtask 1 (100 points): Original constraints.

10 70 10 6 
2 100 4 3
3 3 2 1

```

```
overFlow
filled
Unfilled
overflow

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  Initially the bucket had $1$ litre of water, we then added $3$ litres of water for $4$ hours. Thus, the total bucket inflow was $1 + 3 \times 4 = 13$ litres. Since this is greater than the capacity of $2$ litres, the bucket will `OVERFLOW`

 **Test case $2$:**  Initially the bucket had $10$ litres of water, we then added $10$ litres of water for $6$ hours. Thus, the total bucket inflow was $10 + 10 \times 6 = 70$ litres. Since this is equal to the capacity of $70$ litres, the bucket will be `FILLED`

 **Test case $3$:**  Initially the bucket had $2$ litres of water, we then added $4$ litres of water for $3$ hours. Thus, the total bucket inflow was $2 + 4 \times 3 = 14$ litres. Since this is lesser than the capacity of $100$ litres, the bucket will be `UNFILLED`.

 **Test case $4$:**  Initially the bucket had $3$ litres of water, we then added $2$ litres of water for $1$ hours. Thus, the total bucket inflow was $3 + 2 \times 1 = 5$ litres. Since this is more than the capacity of $3$ litres, the bucket will `OVERFLOW`.
